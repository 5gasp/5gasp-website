relevance: "There are a lot of different wireless technologies nowadays. And among them the decisive role for critical applications (Automotive and PPDR) is given to the 5-th generation mobile technologies. 5G is a key driving force in the development of the ICT industry and other related vertical industries. In these conditions, when a large number of commercial 5G networks are already deployed, software developers begin to develop a large number of network applications for the needs and with the use of 5G. Therefore, it is very important to support developers, small and medium enterprises in order to automatically test, certify and bring to the end customer already debugged applications that can be deployed and used in commercial projects. Therefore, the paper presents the ecosystem for the development and testing of emerging network applications in 5G and beyond environment. This ecosystem combines software developers, test sites in European cities, automated testing and certification tools, end customers (users) of network applications and other tools and systems. And it is mandatory to use NetApp Store, specially developed Marketplace, to bring fully tested and certified network application to the end user or customer. This paper also demonstrates how the methodology developed in the project will be applied in practice on the example of Remote human driving NetApp. In particular, the architecture of the application, the principles of interaction with the test platform, the requirements for the application, the test plan and metrics to be collected were shown."
