relevance: "Network monitoring is an essential feature of management for most digital service providers, since it allows for evaluating the network status and its integration with a service. With the introduction of 5G Networks and implementation of solutions using proprietary 5G Cores, obtaining monitoring data can be challenging. Not only on account of legal aspects, but also due to limitations regarding support or the means by which network monitoring data is provided. Thus, a need for agnostic monitoring solution arises, being the main focus of this work. As such, this paper describes the design and implementation of an agnostic monitoring solution that relies on Software Defining Networking mechanisms. Our monitoring system was developed through open-source technologies and allows for gathering network metrics and expose them via a REST API and a Web UI."
