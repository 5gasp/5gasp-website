relevance: "NFV has risen to be a solution to abstract Network Functions from the hardware, providing numerous advantages to Network Operators. However, many challenges have appeared with the evolution of NFV. An example are the inter-domain scenarios where services are spanned across multiple independent domains. Using VPNs to interconnect all domains can attenuate the difficulties imposed by such scenarios. In this paper, we present a NFV-based solution for deploying full-mesh VPNs to interconnect different administrative domains, without manual intervention."
