relevance: "Inter-domain scenarios are immensely desirable in NFV since they allow network services to span across independent domains. However, providing a communication channel between the services’ components in different domains is challenging, thus the need for mechanisms to simplify and automate this process. One possible approach to this problem is the employment of VPNaaS mechanisms. This work presents a zero-touch and NFV-based full-mesh VPNaaS solution that can be used to establish a VPN mesh network encompassing different independent domains, thus enabling inter-communication between them. Furthermore, the VPN tunnels’ orchestration is fully automated, being achieved without any human intervention."
