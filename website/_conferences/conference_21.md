relevance: "Current 5G vertical service orchestration solutions suffer from several limitations, mainly: (i) lack of standardiza- tion, (ii) monolithic architectures, and (iii) low support for inter- domain scenarios, for instance. This paper proposes the devel- opment of a new 5G vertical service orchestration platform that solves these problems and supports intricate use cases. This new system, named NetOr, will inherit many of the abstractions and functionalities already employed while tackling the mentioned issues while providing increased maintainability, flexibility, and scalability, since a Service-Oriented Architecture was followed."
