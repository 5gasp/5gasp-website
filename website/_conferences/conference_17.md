relevance: "5G mobile communications are bringing a plethora of applications that are challenging existing network infrastructures. These services demand a dynamic, flexible and adaptive infrastructure capable of fulfilling the rigorous requirements they need to operate correctly. Another key point is the need of real-time reactions in the architecture configurations to effectively satisfy changes in the userâ€™s behavior. To address these issues, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigms arise as enablers of the network infrastructures of the future. These technologies will permit the design and development of a new set of network applications that will be dynamically managed and orchestrated over multiple domains in an effortless way. In this work, we present an architecture that interconnects two facilities located in Spain and Japan, which permits the deployment of distributed applications. Besides, we detail how the control and data planes are managed to enable the operation of the system."
