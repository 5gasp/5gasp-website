relevance: "With the standardisation and ongoing deployment of 5G networks, significant efforts have been dedicated by both industry and academia to research future networks in order to meet the projected demand for connectivity. The forthcoming telecommunications networks are anticipated to exhibit a higher degree of distribution, heterogeneity, intelligence, and proximity to end-users than ever before. In order to address these challenges, distributed ML approaches are expected to play a key role. In this paper, we analyse the diferent security and privacy related aspects of deploying the distributed ML approach Federated Learning (FL) in containarised environments as CNFs."
