relevance: "The lack of testing and validation mechanisms for 5G Network Applications poses a severe challenge in ensuring their correct behavior and in reducing their time to market. This work addresses the intricate complexities of validating such Applications and defines some research questions related to this research field. These questions focus on problems that are still unresolved, and based on them we establish future directions for solving such intricate research problems."
