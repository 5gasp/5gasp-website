relevance: "Current orchestration frameworks lack intelligence and handle resources by neglecting service-level and system-wide performance. Towards addressing this gap, we propose a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) design targeting Virtual Network Function (VNF) placement comprised of (i) a local level prediction module deployed at system nodes; and (ii) a global Reinforcement Learning (RL) module topping the hierarchy, utilising live local predictions and adapting placement to system-wide dynamics. Our performance evaluation over our 5GASP supported 5G testbed shows that HRL can significantly outperform both Open Source Mano and heuristic-based VNF placement while reflecting a more complex trade-off between load and e2e delay, particularly under CPU overloading conditions. This work poses a significant contribution to the intelligent orchestration aspects of our 5GASP NetApp under development (NetApp 7)."
