Paper written as a result of the work performed on the european research projects projects 5GASP, Vital 5G and ICT-41. 
The paper aims to describe the 5G architecture and the testbeds for Network Applications. A proposal for a Vehicle Route Optimizer Network Application, from the field of automotive, is presented. This can be tested and deployed following an iterative testing methodology and we introduce a paradigm focused on a fully automated toolchain that caters to the production of any Network Applications with very little human interaction through open source software automation tools. In the context of the 5G-PPP project 5GASP we review the testing, integration and deployment of Network Applications for improved ease of access and distribution."
