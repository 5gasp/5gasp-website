relevance: "In the context of the future development of the 5G (fifth generation) network, this paper focuses on assessing the level of exposure to electromagnetic field generated by mobile telephony stations installed inside buildings. A number of 60 broadband measurements of the power density of the ambient electromagnetic field were performed and the maximum exposure coefficient was calculated as a percentage value in shops belonging to Orange Romania. We also proceeded to the measurement of two office buildings in which the distributed antenna systems are larger than in the case of shops. In this case the measurements were made with a narrowband device with which it was possible to measure the contribution of each technology. For each site power density measurements were made based on the maximum exposure reference values for each technology and the total exposure coefficients were calculated under the hypothesis that the stations would emit at maximum power. The results showed that the exposure to the environmental field in shops is low, being 5 times lower than the reference value in over 90% of cases. In the office premises, where the maximum possible exposure coefficient was estimated, values of over 40% of the reference level were also highlighted, which in the context of 5G installation, if the emission powers are not reduced, could lead to values of the total exposure coefficient that would approach 100% of the reference level."
