relevance: "With a growing commercial and innovation potential for software developers to provide new and innovative 5G-empowered network applications (NetApps) across multiple industry verticals, 5G architecture and infrastructure are challenged to continuously evolve in order to cope with all these NetApps requirements. The paper is focused on 5G architectures adaptation for future NetApps and verticals and begins with a short introduction on 5G current and future environment, then continues with the 5G-PPP projects that contributed to early deployment of 5G testbed in Romania. Further we will focus on the NetApps and vertical context, as they are highlighted through the two 5G-PPP projects, VITAL-5G and 5GASP, the step by step 5G network evolution to support all these challenging NetApps and verticalâ€™s use cases."
