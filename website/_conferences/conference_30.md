relevance: "Most modern 5G Vertical Service Orchestrators present various limitations. Among these, one may high-light (i) the employment of monolithic architectures, (ii) the lack of standardized APIs and methodologies, (iii) the minimum support for inter-domain scenarios, and (iv) the impossibility of performing run-time operations over Vertical Services. To achieve a fully-fledged Vertical Service Orchestrator, these problems must be solved. This is the focus of the work presented in this article. Our work presents a new 5G Vertical Service orchestration system named NetOr, which tackles all the listed limitations and can support complex and intricate use cases. NetOr was implemented according to a microservice architecture. Thus, it has increased flexibility, scalability, and maintain-ability. Moreover, NetOr inherited most advantages of the modern Vertical Service Orchestrators and, therefore, can be considered an improvement of said orchestrators. Furthermore, this work also presents a Proof-of-Concept solution to achieve inter-domain communication through the orchestration of an End-To-End Network Slice that establishes several VPN tunnels between the domains encompassed by the Network Slice."
