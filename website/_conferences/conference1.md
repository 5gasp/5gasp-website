relevance: "This paper studies 5G PPDR experimentation associated with novel virtualized and cloud-native 5G technologies, architectures and deployment options, as well as feasibility studies and field performance and verifications trials involving vertical-specific 5G infrastructures and applications. Key enabling technologies, such as massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO), device-to-device (D2D), network slicing and multi-access edge computing (MEC) are discussed and 5G PPDR architecture and deployment options are investigated. A dedicated 5G PPDR experimentation facility is presented, and a case study of hands-on experimentation is provided. Pilot implementation deploying 5G IOPS as part of the 5GASP project is mentioned with key technology insights (using novel cloud-native techniques to achieve distributed application deployment and required services resilience exploiting OpenStack, Kubernetes, OSM and ONAP concepts)."
