5GASP was established to create a prosperous, network-based application testing and certification environment for SMEs and larger companies alike. The project helps companies profit from the newly-developed configurability of Network Function Visualization (NFV) techniques, implemented on top of Software-Defined Networks (SDN) and the 5G network stack. To do this, the project created an international testbed, which can be used to test and certify the network-based compatibility, as VNFs/CNFs (especially for 5G), availability, security and performance of applications that could be better used in a modular, distributed manner. A CI/CD and certification pipeline for the novel Network(-based) Applications (nApps) was created and implemented in the 5GASP platform.

Thus, on 14th of March took place the 5G Innovations for Verticals workshop in Athens, Greece. This was the last public event of 5GASP and gathered not only 5GASP partners but also partners from 5G-IANA, 5G-Epicentre, Smart5Grid and some external guests from Greece.

In this workshop, 5GASP partners and other ICT-41 projects (5G-IANA, 5G-Epicentre, Smart5Grid) approached the achievements of the 5GASP project and of other ICT-41 projects accordingly, to show and highlight the technological progress made by the projects, assess and discuss the integration of projects and the novel solutions of 5GASP to the community through standardization of software components and Open Source Software contributions.
