5GASP is meeting face-to-face for the second time after a successful meeting in Bucharest in May where we also launched our NetApp Lab (link para press release do NetApp Lab). This time partners will discuss project progress and will present to EC reviewers the results from 1 year and half of work. Besides presentations from Work Package Leaders, demonstrations will highlight the achievements of the project and progress made. Donâ€™t forget to subscribe to our social media for follow ups on the results and videos of the demonstrations.
