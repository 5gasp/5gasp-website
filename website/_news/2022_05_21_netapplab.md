The launch of 5G NetApp Lab by 5GASP project."
On the 19th of May 2022 took place the 5G NetApp Lab Launch Event, delivered by the 5GASP project, online and with free registration. This event was targetted to startups, SMEs and developers who aim to make the most out of 5G technology to deliver valuable products and services to market. Not only the participants got to witness a presentation of many NetApp pitches, but also, for some selected teams, it was given support by mentors with expertise in designing and delivering 5G network solutions. This allowed the teams to get feedback on their business model, test and validate their products in real-life 5G testbeds and intergrate CI/CD supporting tools in their own solutions.
