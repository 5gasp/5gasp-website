            <p>
                As 5G approaches a very high maturity level, testing and validation of 5G solutions has become of utmost
                importance. Since verticals have very different needs, such as the case of the Automotive industry and
                Public
                Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR), it will require different levels of support into taking their
                applications
                and services from concepts, to prototypes and finally to products. However, it is also more and more
                frequent
                that services in different verticals need to exchange data, particularly mobility services, such as
                those
                found
                in connected automobiles and PPDR.

                5GASP aims at shortening the idea-to-market process through the creation of a European testbed for SMEs
                that
                is
                fully
                automated and self-service, in order to foster rapid development and testing of new and innovative
                5G Network Applications
                built
                using
                the 5G NFV based reference architecture. Building on top of existing physical infrastructures, 5GASP
                intends
                to
                focus on
                innovations related to the operation of experiments and tests across several domains, providing software
                support
                tools
                for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) of VNFs in a secure & trusted environment
                for
                European
                SMEs
                capitalizing in the 5G market. 5GASP targets the creation of an Open Source Software (OSS) repository
                and of
                a
                VNF
                marketplace targeting SMEs with OSS examples and building blocks, as well as the incubation of a
                community
                of
                Network Application
                developers assisted with tools and services that can enable an early validation and/or certification of
                products
                and
                services for 5G. We focus on inter-domain use-cases, development of operational tools and procedures
                (supporting
                day-to-day testing and validation activities) and security/trust of 3rd party IPR running in our
                testbeds.
