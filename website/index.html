    <h1>5GASP Project</h1>

    <p>
        As 5G approaches a very high maturity level, testing and validation of 5G solutions has become of utmost
        importance. Since verticals have very different needs, such as the case of the Automotive industry and Public
        Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR), it will require different levels of support into taking their
        applications
        and services from concepts, to prototypes and finally to products. However, it is also more and more frequent
        that services in different verticals need to exchange data, particularly mobility services, such as those found
        in connected automobiles and PPDR.

    <p>
        5GASP aims at shortening the idea-to-market process through the creation of a European testbed for SMEs that is
        fully
        automated and self-service, in order to foster rapid development and testing of new and innovative NetApps built
        using
        the 5G NFV based reference architecture. Building on top of existing physical infrastructures, 5GASP intends to
        focus on
        innovations related to the operation of experiments and tests across several domains, providing software support
        tools
        for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) of VNFs in a secure & trusted environment for
        European
        SMEs
        capitalizing in the 5G market. 5GASP targets the creation of an Open Source Software (OSS) repository and of a
        VNF
        marketplace targeting SMEs with OSS examples and building blocks, as well as the incubation of a community of
        NetApp
        developers assisted with tools and services that can enable an early validation and/or certification of products
        and
        services for 5G. We focus on inter-domain use-cases, development of operational tools and procedures (supporting
        day-to-day testing and validation activities) and security/trust of 3rd party IPR running in our testbeds.

    <p>
        The main technical objective of 5GASP is to build and operate an Open, and Inter-Domain 5G NFV-based Reference
        (Open5G-NFV) ecosystem of Experimental Facilities. This ecosystem will not only integrate existing facilities
        already proven in previous ICT projects but will also lay down the foundations for instantiating fully
        softwarised architectures of vertical industries. Furthermore, it will provide facilities to test and validate
        NetApps taking into consideration vertical-specific requirements. 5GASP will demonstrate its Open5G-NFV
        ecosystem for two very distinct verticals deployed across state-of-the-art 5G infrastructures: Automotive and
        Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR); however, it will also be as generic as possible in order to
        deploy, validate and certify NetApps stemming from other verticals.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Acceleration of the development, testing and certification of NetApps, through the creation of a common
            platform, DevOps tools and a certification roadmap.</li>
        <li>Provide state-of-the-art testbeds where applications for relevant verticals can be tested and validated
            in a
            cost-effective way.</li>
        <li>Innovate technically by addressing inter-domain use-cases, security and trust aspects associated with
            NetApp
            deployment and Operation.</li>
        <li>Provide all the community with state-of-the-art tools for test deployment, test automation, continuous
            integration and monitoring of testbeds, mainly through Open Source Software tools.</li>
        <li>Create a practice community, where developers can share knowledge about 5G NetApps</li>
        <li>Create a business model around a marketplace of NetApps, by which all stakeholders can share revenue.
        </li>
