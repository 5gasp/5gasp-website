## YoGoKo

YoGoKo is an industry-leading SME providing reliable data collection and transfer solutions for connected &
cooperative mobility. YoGoKo has a work force of 14 people, and was founded in 2014 by researchers and engineers
from three internationally renowned French scientific institutes specialized in autonomous driving and Internet
technologies (Inria, Mines ParisTech and IMT Atlantique).

YoGoKo solutions are used to develop services to improve mobility (road safety,, traffic efficiency, cooperation
between vehicles, fleet management) and to meet the future needs of autonomous mobility (position & map update,
fleet management, teleoperation, platooning, …). YoGoKo solutions are based on Y-SMART, a software platform
developed by YoGoKo to securely collect and transfer data. YoGoKo solutions are commercialized either as a turnkey
communication system (YoGoKo software embedded in a hardware vehicle telematic units for pilots,
experimentation and small fleet deployments) or in the form of a software license integrated in specific hardware
platform and customized by YoGoKo engineers to address specific service needs: innovative connected vehicle
services, Cooperative ITS (C-ITS) services, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), autonomous driving,
connected roadside infrastructure equipment (traffic lights, roadside units, …). YoGoKo solutions are for instance
used in pilot deployments of Cooperative ITS services (e.g. 200 road maintenance vehicles equipped by YoGoKo
and in connected autonomous vehicle programs.
