## Odin Solutions S.L.

Odin Solutions (OdinS) is a technology SME founded in August 2014. OdinS works in the fields of Internet of
Things, Big Data, Security and 5G. Our staff has strong expertise in research and development of embedded systems,
monitoring and tele-management of infrastructures, virtualization, and wireless communications. As a matter of fact,
OdinS has several patents in the area of telecontrol systems and building automation.
The OdinS group has a strong background in H2020 projects, and the company currently has a focus on 5G and IoT
technologies for smart mobile deployments, given the challenging multi-RAT communication scenarios they imply
and the possibilities to provide computation offloading for constrained devices. 5GINFIRE especially considers 5G
verticals in the areas of eHealth, transport and smart environments with SDN and NFV capabilities. This aim goes
in line with current ongoing projects in OdinS in data gathering from embedded devices under mobility conditions.
If the research background of the OdinS group is reviewed in detail, it is easy to perceive our strong prototyping and
evaluation character of its R&D activities.
