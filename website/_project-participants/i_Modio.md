Modio’s main software commercial product is the Qiqbus (https://www.modio.io/qiqbus) messaging and analytics
platform. The platform has been designed to operate on a cloud environment. It implements a share-nothing architecture
that allows it to scale to a very large number of users, devices and traffic rate. It is geographically distributed, with each
geographic zone operating in complete isolation from the other zones. The platform is fully multitenant with each tenant
managing her own set of users, devices, processing topologies and alerts.

Modio has employed between 3-10 full-time engineers depending on the commercial projects’ needs.
