## University Of Bristol

University of Bristol is one of the UK’s leading research universities which has engaged in EU funded research for
more than 20 years. The Smart Internet Lab at the University of Bristol is a hub for internet research which addresses
grant societal and industrial challenges. We perform cutting edge research on optical and wireless communications
and offer a unique holistic approach to hardware and software co-design, solving critical problems in the global
internet evolution. We are witnessing the emergence of a smart world, with ‘smart homes’, ‘smart cities’, ‘smart
stadiums’, ‘smart security’, ‘smart energy’, and ‘smart transport’. Our current internet however is unable to scale
enough to support the demand and rapid changes in the way we consume Internet Services. To address this key
limitation and support trillions of internet connected machines, we need to increase network capacity, enhance
coverage reliability and flexibility, lower end-to-end latency and re-design future networks. Our 200 experts on 5G
radio/ wireless, optical communications and networks research challenge the complexity of tomorrow’s world by
fusing research expertise and innovation in a range of research areas such as IoT, 5G and beyond, Future Transport
Networks, Smart Cities, Autonomous Networks, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Network
Convergence, Mobile Edge Computing, Network Softwarization. Our unique offering across optical, wireless, IoT
and cloud technologies enable us to bring together end-to-end network design and optimisation and impact regional,
national and global ICT innovations. As one of the UK’s most renowned Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) research centres we have an exceptionally strong track record on pioneering concepts of
programmable and smart experimental city infrastructures, as well as, developing large-scale applications and
service-oriented networks.

The Smart Internet Lab involves academics and researchers from the Communication Systems & Networks (CSN)
Research Group, the High Performance Networks (HPN) Research Group, the Photonics Research Group, Research
Institutes and experts in other disciplines based at the University of Bristol. High Performance Networks research
group (HPN), led by Professor Nejabati, specializes in the application of advanced hardware and software network
