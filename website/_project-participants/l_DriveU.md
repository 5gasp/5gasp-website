## DriveU

DriveU was established in 2017 as a department of LiveU. After 2 years of operation within LiveU, the department
was spun off in 2019 as a separate company, to focus on the automotive segment. DriveU invented and developed a
new connectivity platform that enables high quality teleoperations for autonomous vehicles. DriveUâ€™s Teleoperations
solution is innovative and goes beyond the state of the art solutions by providing much better performance (as
measured in latency, video quality and communications reliability) as well as enabling a much lower system cost
than other solutions. DriveU believes that its solution will expedite the adoption of autonomous vehicles and, as a
result, enable the autonomous vehicle industry to unlock its full potential.
