## Instituto de Telecomunicações

Instituto de Telecomunicações (ITAv) is a 25-year old, private, non–profit organisation, the outcome of the early association of five institutions with experience and tradition in research and development in the field of Telecommunications: “Instituto Superior Técnico”, “Universidade de Aveiro”, “Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade de Coimbra”, “Portugal Telecom Inovação, S.A.” (now Altice Labs), and “ Siemens” (now Nokia). IT mission is to “create and disseminate scientific knowledge in the field of telecommunications” and thus it undertakes fundamental and applied research in telecommunications in an international context in order to improve higher education and training, both at graduate and postgraduate levels, and the competitiveness of Portuguese industry and Telecommunications operators. IT focuses on providing research and development in the areas relevant to modern and future Tele-communications operations, organizing itself around projects which may vary in size from a couple of person month, such as a final year graduate student project, to some hundreds of person months in large projects. The scope may range from local, to national (involving more than one research center or more than one institution), to European or international with tens of partners. IT is also a developer and contributor to different open-source initiatives, as well as important standard organizations such as IEEE, IETF and the IRTF, as well as contributions to OpenStack. Currently, the Tele-communications and Networking team from Aveiro (engaged in this proposal) is ad-dressing the areas of Future Internet and Mobile Networks Architectures, Machine-to-Machine Communications, Security and Identification, and Novel Service Infrastructures for 5G environments.
