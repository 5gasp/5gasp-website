## NEOBILITY SRL

Neobility is a SME established in 2019 with the vision to revolutionize the urban mobility. Neobility develops
technologies that support the new wave of urban mobility globally, with the aim of radically improving the capacity
and speed of movement of the inhabitants of the cities. The company wants to build the technology that you use
everyday to move around the city using the most sustainable transport resources, ie any means of transport.
Most of the mobility initiatives address personal needs: bicycles, scooters and electric scooters are last-mile solutions
for each of us individually. But what Neobility does is to rethink and address public transportation needs. This
approach has the effect of freeing up traffic, making energy efficient, increasing air quality, ultimately increasing
comfort and shortening transit times for large numbers of people.

Our ambitions are global from day one, and the stakes are huge. Neobility's long-term vision is to become a platform
for cities to adopt in order to optimize their public transport - which also implies a perfectly functional integration
with other personal transport solutions. The problem of urban mobility has a direct impact on the health of the people,
as well as on the economic and real estate development of the cities. An improvement in this area can have a snowball
effect for the whole society.
