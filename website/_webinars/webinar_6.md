about: "ICT-41 Projects target the validation of technologies and architectures for 5G in a system context and for multiple use cases, with performances well beyond those of early 5G trials planned over the 2018-20 period with \"non-standalone\" 5G implementations, and supporting innovative \"vertical\" use cases. It also aims at leveraging 5G technologies towards downstream innovation both at service and product levels, at maintaining a significant long-term commitment to prepare for 5G \"Long Term Evolution\", and at leveraging international cooperation towards industrial consensus on 5G key aspects such as interoperability, architecture, standards, and spectrum. In this scope, 5GASP was established to create a prosperous, network-based application testing and certification environment for SMEs and larger companies alike. The project helps companies profit from the newly-developed configurability of Network Function Visualization (NFV) techniques, implemented on top of Software-Defined Networks (SDN) and the 5G network stack. To do this, the project created an international testbed, which can be used to test and certify the network-based compatibility, as VNFs/CNFs (especially for 5G), availability, security and performance of applications that could be better used in a modular, distributed manner. A CI/CD and certification pipeline for the novel Network(-based) Applications (nApps) was created and implemented in the 5GASP platform.

In this workshop, we will approach the achievements of the project and of other ICT-41 projects, to show and highlight the technological progress made by 5GASP and other ICT-41 projects, assess and discuss the integration of projects and the novel solutions of 5GASP to the community through standardization of software components and Open Source Software contributions."
