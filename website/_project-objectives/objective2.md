## 2. Provide state-of-the-art testbeds where applications for relevant verticals can be tested and validated in a cost-effective way.

Building on previous and existing projects such as 5GinFIRE, 5G VINNI, 5G EVE, 5G MOBIX our project intends to make our partners’ testbeds available to SMEs & start-ups seeking to experiment in developing, testing, and validating their innovative NetApps in a reproducible environment which offers open source tools. Most existing facilities already support various verticals, but 5GASPs’ facilities will be tailored to support NetApps in an optimized, cross-platform and cross-vertical manner. The 5GASP ecosystem encompasses state of the art testbed that provide various 5G technologies, such as NFV and Virtualization. In terms of Virtualization, both traditional Virtual Machines as well as containerized platforms will be made available. In terms of NFV, all 5GASP testbeds follow the ETSI NFV reference architecture offering the two most-known solutions of OSM and ONAP, while supporting both modelling and packaging according to the ETSI standards OSM/SOL006(YANG model) and ONAP/SOL001(TOSCA). In terms of the overall offered 5G system, 5GASPs’ facilities offer 5G New Radio and 5G Systems supporting both 5GNSA and 5G SA, while various MEC solutions are available. In certain locations there are also dedicated resources (e.g. RSUs, OBUs) that will be tailored for NetApps’ usage.

### Innovations:

* Cross-model delivery of NetApps.
* Leverage of vertical-based use cases over existing experimental facilities.
* Leverage abstraction capabilities of existing testbeds, allowing SME’s to deploy their multi domain NetApps. independently of the underlying aspects of participating to 5GASP testbeds.
