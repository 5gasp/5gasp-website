description: Innovate technically by addressing inter-domain use-cases, security and trust aspects associated with NetApp deployment and Operation.
---

Albeit all work done by researchers in previous and ongoing projects, aspects related to inter-domain use-cases as
well as security and trust aspects associated with running 3rd party software (NetApps) in critical network
environments such as those associated with the Automotive and PPDR verticals, have not been fully tackled. In
5GASP we will address these issues pragmatically from the viewpoint of the companies developing and deploying
their NetApps, requiring safety for their IPR and from the viewpoint of the network operator which must trust on
the correct and limited behaviour of the NetApp in its network. We will investigate the most recent Cooperative ITS
standards developed at ISO TC 204 / CEN TC 278 which allows the sharing of data across service domains and
spanning multiple networks and will research how to apply them to other verticals. Moreover, in 5GASP we will
work with Network Operators in scenarios that actually not only fit from a technical perspective, but also scenarios
that do fit the business models of network operators.

### Innovations:

* Inter-domain orchestration of NetApps spanning multiple networks.
* Trustworthy behaviour monitoring and resource usage accounting.
* Safe and Secure multi domain sandboxing of NetApps.
* Cyber Mimic Defence techniques for offending NetApps.
* Platform endpoint and implementation randomization.
