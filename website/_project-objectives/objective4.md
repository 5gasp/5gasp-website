description: Automate the process of testing and validation, lowering cost associated with testing and certification of NetApps in telecommunication environment.
---


Network Operators have an extensive knowledge on Testing and Validation in Communication Networks. They are
also aware of the high financial and time costs associated with testing new hardware and software. In the modern
world of IT technologies that have very short cycles between development, testing and production, such as 5G
NetApps, automated tools and processes are of high demand for all the proof of concept, acceptance, regression
testing and validations processes, keeping costs relatively low and yet having access to certification processes. In
5GASP we want to provide the blueprints for everyone in the NetApp ecosystem, enabling the setup of automated
testing of NetApps. Of course, not all vertical-specific testing processes can be automated given the limited resources
of this project, , but it is our project goal to provide documentation in the form of public guidelines and best practises
to assist third parties to build on our work to achieve their own specific goals.

### Innovations:

* Integration of multiple tiered-level blueprints (from basic to expert) exposing and enabling automated testing and certification of key execution steps for NetApps.
* Single workflow for testing of NetApps in multiple configurations and testbeds.
