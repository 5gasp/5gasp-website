description: Create a business model around a marketplace of 5G Network Applications, by which all stakeholders can share revenue.
---


A key innovation of our project is the creation of a marketplace portal (Network Application Store) that aggregates Network Applications from several SME’s or any other Network Application developer in a single location curated by the Network Applications Community. The portal will include information of tests/validations which Network Applications have successfully passed as well as testbeds and Network Operators that have successfully deployed the Network Application. The purpose of this portal is to promote the SME’s and their respective Network Applications as well as the platforms and operators that support them. Furthermore, this portal has the potential to be marketed in a way similar in to stores for mobile apps, such as Apples App Store and Google Play. The business model based on a Network Application Store assumes that SMEs and start-ups developing Network Applications can offer their tested and certified products, which can be deployed in minutes, to service providers and other users and developers who will leverage by employing these reusable network applications in their business. Business models will be developed and validated aiming to the sustainability of the 5GASP business solution. The business planning process shall cover the entire value chain identifying the stakeholders for each step of the chain. This involves: (i) the identification of points of exploitation in the system, (ii) the definition of different billing/costing (revenue streams) models to the end users and (iii) reimbursement models to the Network Application creators and/or experimental infrastructure providers.

### Innovations:

* Development of the Network Application Store portal and accumulation of testbeds and 5GASP-certified reusable Network Applications.
* Development of business models for the 5GASP business endeavour.
