title: Objective 7
description: Create a business model around a marketplace of NetApps, by which all stakeholders can share revenue.
---


A key innovation of our project is the creation of a marketplace portal (NetAppStore) that aggregates NetApps from
several SME’s or any other NetApp developer in a single location curated by the NetApps Community. The portal
will include information of tests/validations which NetApps have successfully passed as well as testbeds and Network
Operators that have successfully deployed the NetApp. The purpose of this portal is to promote the SME’s and their
respective NetApps as well as the platforms and operators that support them. Furthermore, this portal has the
potential to be marketed in a way similar in to stores for mobile apps, such as Apples App Store and Google Play.
The business model based on a NetAppStore assumes that SMEs and start-ups developing NetApps can offer their
tested and certified products, which can be deployed in minutes, to service providers and other users and developers
who will leverage by employing these reusable network applications in their business.
Business models will be developed and validated aiming to the sustainability of the 5GASP business solution. The
business planning process shall cover the entire value chain identifying the stakeholders for each step of the chain.
This involves: (i) the identification of points of exploitation in the system, (ii) the definition of different
billing/costing (revenue streams) models to the end users and (iii) reimbursement models to the NetApp creators
and/or experimental infrastructure providers.

### Innovations:

* Development of the NetAppStore portal and accumulation of testbeds and 5GASP-certified reusable NetApps.
* Development of business models for the 5GASP business endeavour.
