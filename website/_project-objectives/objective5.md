title: Objective 5

## 5. Provide all the community with state-of-the-art tools for test deployment, test automation, continuous integration and monitoring of testbeds, mainly through Open Source Software tools.

5GASP plans the development of software tools that can assist the NetApp developers in building Continuous
Integrations frameworks, targeted at their specific vertical, consisting mostly out of OSS tools and producing reports
that can be used to start certification processes. These open tools are a strict requirement of our previous objective
and are vital to the success of creating a NetApps ecosystem built around SMEâ€™s. Our proposal is to innovate through
new DevOps and testing tools, emulation of vertical environments for performance testing, stress testing of
Automotive and PPDR NetApps under realistic loads and validation of inter-operability between different 5G
infrastructure providers (e.g. OSM vs ONAP).

### Innovations:

* New CI/CD tools targeting NetApps Open source deployment and testing tools and services that are currently offered only by commercial solutions.
