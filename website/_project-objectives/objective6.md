## 6. Create a practice community, where developers can share knowledge about 5G NetApps

The socialization of NetApps developers is of outmost importance in the success of our ecosystem. Only through a
tight support community, built upon trust and information sharing, can SMEs and start-ups find the proper
documentation and a number of open source reference NetApps to achieve their commercial goals in this new
‘softwarized’ 5G business market. It is our goal to promote tighter and seamless integrated methodologies between
community tools, and the development/testing mechanisms developed within 5GASP. Community Building play an
important role in the foreseen outcomes of the project, as we intend that this open community can outlive the project
duration and maintain the developed tools in future to come.

### Innovations:

* Creation of a NetApps Community of Practice (NetAppCommunity).
