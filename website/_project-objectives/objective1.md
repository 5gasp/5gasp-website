title: Objective 1
description: Acceleration of the development, testing and certification of Network Applications, through the creation of a common platform, DevOps tools and a certification roadmap.

The 5G concept does not only aim at providing higher capacity and lower latency but also at increasing the level of programmability, control and flexibility in order to meet the requirements stemming from innovative use-cases from various vertical sectors. To reduce the time-to-market for novel 5G Network Applications from third party developers, an integrated development and operations (DevOps) methodology is the way to move forward. Furthermore, 5GASP will address the challenges of validation, verification and certification of 5G Network Applications, so that operators are aware of their behaviour before deploying them on their production network. To achieve all the above, 5GASP introduces novel procedures and a novel fully automated toolchain that caters for the production of any Network Application with very little or without any human interaction through OSS automation tools. These novelties shall be demonstrated on top of well-known and mature 5G facilities, 5G services and 5G/NFV experimentation tools to overall offer a DevOps-like and open platform for deploying, validating, verifying and certifying Network Applications.


### Innovations:

* A fully automated and open DevOps based CI/CD process for developers, which shall be able to translate their applications/services into Network Applications.
Seamless deployments against different execution environments and models (OSM, ONAP).
* Perform Network Applications certification-readiness procedures against well-known standards.
* Offer an open source Network Applications marketplace to 5G stakeholders (SMEs, telecom operators, service providers) that will contain ready-to-deploy services in 5G production environments.
