<p>Instituto de Telecomunicações (ITAv) is a 25-year old, private, non–profit organisation, the outcome of the early association of five institutions with experience and tradition in research and development in the field of Telecommunications: “Instituto Superior Técnico”, “Universidade de Aveiro”, “Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade de Coimbra”, “Portugal Telecom Inovação, S.A.” (now Altice Labs), and “ Siemens” (now Nokia). IT mission is to “create and disseminate scientific knowledge in the field of telecommunications” and thus it undertakes fundamental and applied research in telecommunications in an international context in order to improve higher education and training, both at graduate and postgraduate levels, and the competitiveness of Portuguese industry and Telecommunications operators. IT focuses on providing research and development in the areas relevant to modern and future Tele-communications operations, organizing itself around projects which may vary in size from a couple of person month, such as a final year graduate student project, to some hundreds of person months in large projects. The scope may range from local, to national (involving more than one research center or more than one institution), to European or international with tens of partners. IT is also a developer and contributor to different open-source initiatives, as well as important standard organizations such as IEEE, IETF and the IRTF, as well as contributions to OpenStack. Currently, the Tele-communications and Networking team from Aveiro (engaged in this proposal) is ad-dressing the areas of Future Internet and Mobile Networks Architectures, Machine-to-Machine Communications, Security and Identification, and Novel Service Infrastructures for 5G environments.</p>

<p>UoP is the third largest university in Greece with each own campus in the outskirts of Patras city. The Network
Architectures and Management (NAM) group (http://nam.ece.upatras.gr/) which represent the research aspect of the
Greek cluster in this project acquired its expertise through collaborations with industry and a series of research
national and European projects. It is currently comprised of 2 professors, 4 post-docs, 2 researchers-system
developers and 7 PhD students. During the last ten years we have involved in many Future Internet Research (FIRE)
projects: Panlab-PII, OpenLab, FORGE and coordinated others like VITAL++ and STEER. UoP is currently
deploying one of the main 5G facilities in 5G-VINNI, an ICT 17 project. This facility is used to host verticals and
applications from two ICT 19 projects, namely, 5G-SOLUTIONS and 5G-VICTORI. We are also maintainers of
http://sence.city a service that engages citizens to report issues across their city and the ThingsNetwork IoT
infrastructure/community in Patras. Finally, UoP has participated and successfully completed Proof of Concept #14
for the NFV ISG and performed two successful demonstrations in IETF’s 88 and 90.</p>

<p>University of Bristol is one of the UK’s leading research universities which has engaged in EU funded research for
more than 20 years. The Smart Internet Lab at the University of Bristol is a hub for internet research which addresses
grant societal and industrial challenges. We perform cutting edge research on optical and wireless communications
and offer a unique holistic approach to hardware and software co-design, solving critical problems in the global
internet evolution. We are witnessing the emergence of a smart world, with ‘smart homes’, ‘smart cities’, ‘smart
stadiums’, ‘smart security’, ‘smart energy’, and ‘smart transport’. Our current internet however is unable to scale
enough to support the demand and rapid changes in the way we consume Internet Services. To address this key
limitation and support trillions of internet connected machines, we need to increase network capacity, enhance
coverage reliability and flexibility, lower end-to-end latency and re-design future networks. Our 200 experts on 5G
radio/ wireless, optical communications and networks research challenge the complexity of tomorrow’s world by
fusing research expertise and innovation in a range of research areas such as IoT, 5G and beyond, Future Transport
Networks, Smart Cities, Autonomous Networks, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Network
Convergence, Mobile Edge Computing, Network Softwarization. Our unique offering across optical, wireless, IoT
and cloud technologies enable us to bring together end-to-end network design and optimisation and impact regional,
national and global ICT innovations. As one of the UK’s most renowned Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) research centres we have an exceptionally strong track record on pioneering concepts of
programmable and smart experimental city infrastructures, as well as, developing large-scale applications and
service-oriented networks.</p>

<p>The Smart Internet Lab involves academics and researchers from the Communication Systems &amp; Networks (CSN)
Research Group, the High Performance Networks (HPN) Research Group, the Photonics Research Group, Research
Institutes and experts in other disciplines based at the University of Bristol. High Performance Networks research
group (HPN), led by Professor Nejabati, specializes in the application of advanced hardware and software network</p>

OdinS has several patents in the area of telecontrol systems and building automation.
The OdinS group has a strong background in H2020 projects, and the company currently has a focus on 5G and IoT
technologies for smart mobile deployments, given the challenging multi-RAT communication scenarios they imply
and the possibilities to provide computation offloading for constrained devices. 5GINFIRE especially considers 5G
verticals in the areas of eHealth, transport and smart environments with SDN and NFV capabilities. This aim goes
in line with current ongoing projects in OdinS in data gathering from embedded devices under mobility conditions.
If the research background of the OdinS group is reviewed in detail, it is easy to perceive our strong prototyping and
evaluation character of its R&amp;D activities.</p>

<p>DriveU was established in 2017 as a department of LiveU. After 2 years of operation within LiveU, the department
was spun off in 2019 as a separate company, to focus on the automotive segment. DriveU invented and developed a
new connectivity platform that enables high quality teleoperations for autonomous vehicles. DriveU’s Teleoperations
solution is innovative and goes beyond the state of the art solutions by providing much better performance (as
measured in latency, video quality and communications reliability) as well as enabling a much lower system cost
than other solutions. DriveU believes that its solution will expedite the adoption of autonomous vehicles and, as a
result, enable the autonomous vehicle industry to unlock its full potential.</p>

<p>Neobility is a SME established in 2019 with the vision to revolutionize the urban mobility. Neobility develops
technologies that support the new wave of urban mobility globally, with the aim of radically improving the capacity
and speed of movement of the inhabitants of the cities. The company wants to build the technology that you use
everyday to move around the city using the most sustainable transport resources, ie any means of transport.
Most of the mobility initiatives address personal needs: bicycles, scooters and electric scooters are last-mile solutions
for each of us individually. But what Neobility does is to rethink and address public transportation needs. This
approach has the effect of freeing up traffic, making energy efficient, increasing air quality, ultimately increasing
comfort and shortening transit times for large numbers of people.</p>

<p>Our ambitions are global from day one, and the stakes are huge. Neobility’s long-term vision is to become a platform
for cities to adopt in order to optimize their public transport - which also implies a perfectly functional integration
with other personal transport solutions. The problem of urban mobility has a direct impact on the health of the people,
as well as on the economic and real estate development of the cities. An improvement in this area can have a snowball
effect for the whole society.</p>
