ITAv is a Research Institution that mediates knowledge transfer from academia to industry. The team participating in 5GASP will fully embrace this mission by not only developing research, but also supporting European Industries (either startups or incumbent operators) in adopting the technologies associated with NetApps. ITAv envisages securing an optimal knowledge transfer to all relevant parties through educational content, opensource contributions and standardization contributions. The focus for participation in events will target high-profile events and scientific conferences sponsored by international technical societies (e.g., IEEE, IFIP, IFAC, ACM). For publications of the most valuable project developments and results, high-impact scientific journals will be pursued.
