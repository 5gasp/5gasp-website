ICARUS experiment relied on the use of the PPDR ONE infrastructure, while the inclusion of the qMON network sensors was necessary mainly for the IoT data provision. Within this 5GINFIRE experimental framework, ICARUS experiment aimed at researching the 5G opportunity for Internet of Things (IoT) interoperability and openness framework through the agility provided by the use of SDN and NFV as engineering tools, which provide the distributed intelligence to analyze and manage traffic flows. In specific, ICARUS combined the agility of a virtual Deep Packet Inspection (vDPI) function with the flexibility of data protocol mapping functions (e.g. CoAP, MQTT, HTTP to generic UDP), allowing to the overlay IoT services to be automatically deployed and programmed by a single domain coordinator/orchestrator/experimenter. Our main objective of the SDN/NFV-enabled IoT ICARUS experiment was to expand the interoperability level of the 5GINFIRE/PPDR ONE by providing an agile manner for data interoperability. By coupling a vDPI-based protocol detection process with the automatic applicability of the appropriate SDN steering commands of the heterogeneous IoT traffic to the correct IoT protocol-mapping VNFs, ICARUS can achieve interoperable communications by providing to 5GINFIRE infrastructure the proposed interoperability functionalities.
