The 5G standards provided by 3GPP already bring support for mission critical communications, with support for low latency flows, dynamic allocation of resources, resource isolation and push-to-video. However, despite such features, diverse applications, known as Application Functions (AFs) in the 3GPP Service Based Architecture (SBA), need to communicate their specialized requirements to the 5G Core (5GC) when employed in mission critical services. With Sec5G, OneSource aims at validating the concept of employing NEF as the entry point for Public Protection and Disaster Recovery (PPDR) services in the 5GC, enabling the adjustment of 5G networks to the requirements of such services. While NEF can enable the wider adoption of 5G by providing a set of functionalities allowing a dynamic configuration of the network, performance, security and reliability are of utmost importance for PPDR missions.
