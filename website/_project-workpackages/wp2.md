### Objectives:

This task will identify the current state-of the art of Cloud, NFV, MANO, CI/CD in terms of open, most mature projects
and technologies, to choose the ones to be integrated as basis for 5GASP open platform. It will evaluate existing efforts
in EU funded projects and Open Source solutions (many of them made available by 5GASP partners) to define the
integration and development work inside 5GASP.
This WP will set up the reference architecture and DevOps-like processes for the 5GASP experimentation infrastructure.
The requirements will be provided from the 5GASP NetApps, the use cases and the interoperability goals that 5GASP
wants to achieve. 

The objectives are:
- To define the requirements for a unified 5G/NFV experimentation infrastructure for enabling 5G NetApps for
interoperability with well-defined industry standard interfaces, integration with orchestration platforms,
analytics, virtual infrastructure managers, and cloud native and SDN platforms.
- To define a process for automated transformation of vertical applications to interoperable 5G/NFV artefacts
- To define the architecture of 5GASP open repository and knowledge base.
- To define the various components of the 5GASP infrastructure in such a manner that are open, interoperable,
extensible and standard.
- To design the 5GASP experimentation infrastructure to support i) standardized 5G/NFV interfaces, ii) multidomain
scenarios, iii) seamless integration of 5G/NFV technologies, iv) automated transformations of 5G/NFV models.
