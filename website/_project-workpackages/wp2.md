### Coordinator: 
VMWARE

### Objectives:

- Define the requirements for a unified 5G/NFV experimentation infrastructure for enabling 5G NetApps for
interoperability with well-defined industry standard interfaces, integration with orchestration platforms,
analytics, virtual infrastructure managers, and cloud native and SDN platforms.
- Define a process for automated transformation of vertical applications to interoperable 5G/NFV artefacts
- Define the architecture of 5GASP open repository and knowledge base.
- Define the various components of the 5GASP infrastructure in such a manner that are open, interoperable,
extensible and standard.
- Design the 5GASP experimentation infrastructure to support i) standardized 5G/NFV interfaces, ii) multidomain
scenarios, iii) seamless integration of 5G/NFV technologies, iv) automated transformations of 5G/NFV models.
