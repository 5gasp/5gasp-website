### Coordinator: 
EANTC

### Objectives:

Main objective of WP5 is to address how NetApps can be tested by network operators for the purpose of operation of
the NetApp in a production environment. This WP is based on pre-testing of NetApps developed in WP4 for basic
interoperability with various Network Operator assets such as MANO tools (e.g. OSM, ONAP) and standardized 5G
deployments. 

The following are the key objectives that WP5 will address:
- To develop an automated process that will onboard NetApps, through the collection of information from
developers, enabling the profiling of NetApps.
- To develop the testing framework and tools based on opensource software.
- To assess and score NetApps providing a rating of compliance with our tests., Through the execution of
automated tests in the 5GASP CI/CD platform.
- To prepare the process and tools for the Certification process for SMEs .
