description: Network Applications Design & Development

### Coordinator: 
OdinS

### Objectives:

- Define a methodology that establishes the limits of a Network Application and the rules and interfaces that assures them secure
interoperability beyond vendor-specific implementations across multiple domains and availability of related standards or reference implementations. This methodology will allow the orchestration of 5G Network Applications to conform to a more
valuable and complete service in operatorsâ€™ production environments.
- Continuously refactor the envisaged Network Applications to be fully automated for the CI/CD process.
- Resolve issues raised on Network Applications during the testing phases.
- Provide feedback to tailor facilities according to the needs of the Network Application and the Vertical.
- Starting from the already developed SMEs solutions specifically for the involved vertical (Automotive and PPDR),
formulate principles and recommendations that guide SMEs to the successful creation of a Network Application. Good practices
and lessons learnt will be identified taking into account the specificity of each vertical.
