description: NetApps Design & Development
---

### Coordinator: 
OdinS

### Objectives:

- Define a methodology that establishes the limits of a NetApp and the rules and interfaces that assures them secure
interoperability beyond vendor-specific implementations across multiple domains and availability of related standards or reference implementations. This methodology will allow the orchestration of NetApps to conform to a more
valuable and complete service in operatorsâ€™ production environments.
- Continuously refactor the envisaged NetApps to be fully automated for the CI/CD process.
- Resolve issues raised on NetApps during the testing phases.
- Provide feedback to tailor facilities according to the needs of the NetApp and the Vertical.
- Starting from the already developed SMEs solutions specifically for the involved vertical (Automotive and PPDR),
formulate principles and recommendations that guide SMEs to the successful creation of a NetApp. Good practices
and lessons learnt will be identified taking into account the specificity of each vertical.
