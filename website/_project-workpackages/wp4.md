description: NetApps Design & Development

### Coordinator: 
OdinS

### Objectives:

This WP contains the necessary effort to transform the 5GASP envisaged solutions to NetApps ready to be automated
and onboarded to testbeds via the CI/CD process. The 5GASP SME partners solutions will be modelled, designed,
transformed, and developed as NetApps in such a way that will allow to be interoperable across facilities following a
diverse set of underlying NFV/5G solutions. In cases that NetApps follow a specific model the process will help the
enhancement of WP3 services, like the automated model translation to enhance the NetApp archive model and
embedded entities for the target facility NFV Orchestrator, depending on the defined model (YANG or TOSCA).
Especially, in this WP, the “VNFication” phase of the 5GASP envisaged V-Model methodology will be followed
according to the requirements set by WP2. 

Specifically, WP4 shall:

- Define a methodology that establishes the limits of a NetApp and the rules and interfaces that assures them secure
interoperability beyond vendor-specific implementations across multiple domains and availability of related standards or reference implementations. This methodology will allow the orchestration of NetApps to conform to a more
valuable and complete service in operators’ production environments.
- Continuously refactor the envisaged NetApps to be fully automated for the CI/CD process.
- Resolve issues raised on NetApps during the testing phases.
- Provide feedback to tailor facilities according to the needs of the NetApp and the Vertical.
- Starting from the already developed SMEs solutions specifically for the involved vertical (Automotive and PPDR),
formulate principles and recommendations that guide SMEs to the successful creation of a NetApp. Good practices
and lessons learnt will be identified taking into account the specificity of each vertical.
