### Coordinator: 
BLB

### Objectives:

* Conduct a thorough market investigation to identify the position of the 5GASP within the market,
understand the level of competition and most importantly establish the viability of the concept in the 5G/NFV
market.
* Establish an IPR framework, commonly acceptable by all 5GASP partners. The framework must not only
provide the necessary guidelines of how background and foreground IPR will be managed but it shall consider
how knowledge produced during the project could be exploited by a potential future business endeavour not
hindered byindividual IPR claims.
* Prepare a realistic dissemination plan suitable for presenting the 5GASP concept in relevant audiences.
