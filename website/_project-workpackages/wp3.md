title: WP3
description: Infrastructure Integration & Experimentation Enablement Start Date
---

### Coordinator: 
UoP

### Objectives:

This WP will prepare the distributed Infrastructure and Experimentation environment, facing the experimenter. The
tasks in this WP will implement the tools and middleware that adapt the NetApps requirements in actions for the
orchestration services as well as implement uniform standardized APIs for experiment requests. This WP will make
available an operational NFV MANO stack, supporting the experimentation platform and integrated with the
experimenter-facing tools and services. Finally, this WP will integrate the distributed 5G/NFV experimentation facilities
with the developed experimentation services, in order to address the requirements and architecture defined in WP2.

Specifically, WP3 will:
- Implement and deliver the 5GASP unified 5G/NFV experimentation services and infrastructure as an open source
reference implementation.
- Support and Implement the DevOps paradigm for the NetApps experimentation process.
- Implement automated, secure and trusted mechanisms for management and orchestration of NetApps to support
seamless repeatable experimentation cycles.
- Deliver a platform that can host and append current or future 5G/NFV testbeds, software/hardware components
therein that are close to market rollouts.
- Adapt existing legacy protocols, services and applications of verticals to ease 5G/NFV paradigm adoption.
- Build an NFV/SDN fabric that will effectively interconnect the geographically distributed 5G/NFV
experimentation facilities and resources with 5G Systems and Mobile Edge & Mobile Core subsystems.
